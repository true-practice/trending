					<p class="text">Welcome to the beautiful islands of Trinidad and Tobago. The country is the southernmost island country in the Caribbean and has a rich history and a vibrant culture that has through centuries developed under Asian, African and European influences, resulting in a place like no other. Home to endless breathtaking natural pearls and charming locals who welcome visitors with open arms, Trinidad and Tobago is a must-visit when in the Caribbean. To give you an idea of what the country has to offer, we at PackitUp have put together the ultimate bucket list for Trinidad and Tobago. Enjoy!<br><br>


Explore Port of Spain: The capital of Trinidad and Tobago, Port of Spain, is the perfect Caribbean location. The country has a long and rich history which has sculptured it´s culture with influences from Spain, England, France, Africa, Middle-East, India, China and more. This wide array of influences is reflected throughout the vibrant Port of Spain. Enjoy some Trini breakfast, take a run through Queen´s Park Savannah or join the party for the annual Trinidad and Tobago Carnival. Like the locals say, there´s always something going on in “town”.<br><br>

Maracas Bay: Located only 40 minutes away from Port of Spain is one of the most, if not the most famous beach in Trinidad and Tobago, Maracas Beach. This palm-fringed strip of golden sand, protected by a deep bay, is the perfect spot for a relaxing day. The scenic drive from the capital to Maracas Bay offers breathtaking views of mountainous rain forests and lush peninsulas, jutting into the sea.<br><br>

Pigeon Point: Now we´ve covered Trinidad´s most beautiful beach but Tobago´s beaches might be even better. Pigeon Point is Tobago´s best beach according to many people. This coral-sand coast may require a entry fee but is must certainly worth it. The area has to offer multiple restaurants, shops and bars and beach visitors can rent sun loungers. The crystal-clear turquoise water makes the area and attractive location for snorkeling and beach visitors have the opportunity to go on guided snorkeling tours to Buccoo Reef.<br><br>

Asa Wright Nature Centre: Created to conserve a part of the Arima Valley, Asa Wright Nature Centre is a small but beautiful park buried among mountains, deep in the rainforest. The centre is a leader in eco-tourism which at the same time promotes education an research in every possible way. The AWNC is famous for it´s amazing diversity in in animal and plant species.

Little Tobago: This small island is the most eastern point of Trinidad and Tobago. It´s often called “Bird of Paradise Island” due it´s vibrant and peaceful birdlife. The island has a rich history and used to be a leading cotton plantation in the Caribbean during the later half of the 18th century. Little Tobago is the perfect location when you´re in need for a peaceful yet beautiful day trip.<br><br>

Englishmans Bay: Okay we´ve already mentioned two famous beaches on this list, but if you´re looking to escape beach traffic this is the one for you. Located on the leeward coast of Tobago, Englishmans Bay is a secluded beach, perfect for a relaxing day.<br><br>

Argyle Waterfalls: Tobago´s tallest waterfall at 54 meters, Argyle waterfalls attracts both locals and visitors to its cascade of cool, crisp water that flows down from three dramatic levels. To get to the waterfalls you must trek through a well marked and beautiful path for about 15-20 minutes. If you want, you can hire a guide to hike with you and explain the areas birdlife. Keep in mind that the entry fee to the waterfalls is 60 TT$.<br><br>

Pitch Lake: Being the largest asphalt lake in the world, Pitch lake has through centuries attracted researchers and scientists. Don´t worry, you don´t have to be a scientist to enjoy its beauty. Walk on the semisolid surface, visit the small museum or go all the way and take a guided tour to learn about he geological history of the place and swim in the healing natural springs. <a href="https://packitup.io/blog/the-ultimate-bermuda-travel-guide/"> Check the Ultimate BERMUDA guide here!
